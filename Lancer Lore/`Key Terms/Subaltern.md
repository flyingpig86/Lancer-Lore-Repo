Robotic drones used for a variety of industrial, logistical, and military tasks, <u>subalterns</u> are a common sight across many worlds in and around [[``Union|Union]] space. Unlike other drones, <u>subalterns</u> tend to be humanoform in design, which allows them to interface with vehicles and tools already adapted for human use. As a result, while they may not have the advanced capabilities of more specialized, singlepurpose drone models, they are extremely flexible platforms. <u>Subalterns</u> can be directed by either basic [[Artificial Intelligence#Com/Cons|Comp/Cons]] systems or [[Non-Human Persons|NHPs]], the latter of which sometimes use <u>subalterns</u> as physical avatars for moving around the world and interacting with people directly. <u>Subaltern</u> designs vary tremendously in terms of aesthetic and functional considerations. They range from near-human models with synthetic skin, musculature, and faces that lift them just out of the uncanny valley through to military models stripped of nonessential cosmetics in favor of robust superstructures, armor plating, hardened electronics, and aggressive postures.
