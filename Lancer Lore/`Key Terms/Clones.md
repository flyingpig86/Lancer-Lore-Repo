Exceptional pilots – especially lancers – represent tremendous investments in hardware and training; as such, they tend to have powerful, well-connected patrons with an interest in maintaining their investments. It’s no surprise, then, that technologies exist to replace deceased pilots with subjective [[Clones#Facsimile Clones|facsimiles]] or – if time doesn't permit – to create imperfect, [[Clones#Flashgrown|flashgrown]] genetic clones.

Unique-subjectivity, natural-life [[Clones#Facsimile Clones|“facsimile”]] clones are their own people – legally, culturally, and cognitively – and are common throughout the galaxy (in terrestrial world colonization, for example, first- and second generation cloning is the norm). [[Clones#Flash Clones|Flash clones]] are far less common, as the practice is broadly unlawful. Subjectivity override of either a flash or facsimile clone is exceedingly rare.

Growing a body is easy; it is a very different thing – and much more fraught – to override a <u>clone’s</u> natural subjectivity with the cobbled-together cognitive profile of the deceased. [[Clones#Facsimile Clones|Facsimile]] subjectivity cloning is incredibly expensive, subject to intense scrutiny, and restricted to approved entities; Unless a pilot is lucky enough to work for an organization with [[``Union|Union's]] express sanction to run one of these rare and arguably unethical cloning programs, any cloning that does take place is probably unlawful.

## Complications
(Page 83, Core Book)

While facsimile clones suffer fewer physical complications than flash clones, subjectivity override – whether applied to a facsimile or flash clone – is an experimental process that always creates complications, personal and social. 

Unless the other members of a character’s team know that subjectivity override is possible, it’s going to be a hell of a surprise to see their comrade back from the dead. As for the revivified pilot themselves, they might have to wrestle with the “gap” in their memory. This “gap” necessarily means they don’t remember any events or interactions after the beginning of the session in which they died, although they keep all LL advancement.

It is up to the player whether they want to bring a slain character back as a subjectivity-override clone, or if they simply want to make a new character. It’s important to remember that even if a clone has had a subjectivity override, this does not mean that they are the same person as the character who died: they look the same and share an imprint of the deceased’s memories, drawing from them to act in novel situations; the original pilot who was killed is dead, their consciousness ended, forever. 
By default, the following conditions apply to both facsimile- and flash-cloned characters, but they can be tweaked by the GM as needed:
	•Cloned characters can’t join a mission in progress.
	•Flash-cloned characters always come back with a quirk (see below).
	•Additional cloning and subjectivity imprinting adds further quirks.


## Quirks
(Page 83, Core Book)

Quirks can be physical or mental in nature, but they’re always complicating. Whatever they are, they should offer story hooks or create interesting narrative situations – they don’t have significant gameplay effects.

Optionally, quirks might also be given to characters who go DOWN AND OUT – representing the lingering trauma of such a close encounter with death – or to characters who have died and been brought back to life by the GM’s discretion or a twist in the narrative.

If you want to roll for a random quirk, you can roll 1d20 or choose from the below chart. You can use these as examples for designing quirks of your own if you want to decide on a custom quirk with your GM.
