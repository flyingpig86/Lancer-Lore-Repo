Exceptional pilots – especially lancers – represent tremendous investments in hardware and training; as such, they tend to have powerful, well-connected patrons with an interest in maintaining their investments. It’s no surprise, then, that technologies exist to replace deceased pilots with subjective [[Clones#Facsimile Clones|facsimiles]] or – if time doesn't permit – to create imperfect, [[Clones#Flashgrown|flashgrown]] genetic clones.

Unique-subjectivity, natural-life [[Clones#Facsimile Clones|“facsimile”]] clones are their own people – legally, culturally, and cognitively – and are common throughout the galaxy (in terrestrial world colonization, for example, first- and second generation cloning is the norm). [[Clones#Flash Clones|Flash clones]] are far less common, as the practice is broadly unlawful. Subjectivity override of either a flash or facsimile clone is exceedingly rare.

Growing a body is easy; it is a very different thing – and much more fraught – to override a <u>clone’s</u> natural subjectivity with the cobbled-together cognitive profile of the deceased. [[Clones#Facsimile Clones|Facsimile]] subjectivity cloning is incredibly expensive, subject to intense scrutiny, and restricted to approved entities; Unless a pilot is lucky enough to work for an organization with [[``Union|Union's]] express sanction to run one of these rare and arguably unethical cloning programs, any cloning that does take place is probably unlawful.

# Facsimile Clones
#update 
Under [[Third Committee|ThirdComm]], cloning – that is, the cultivation and growth of whole or partial genetic facsimiles of persons and other fauna, whether cultivated in realtime or via catalytic processes – occupies a spectrum of legality, morality, and ethics. 

To legally clone a person or their constituent parts requires informed consent from the donor. They must understand that full-body clones are their own persons, with their own subjectivity and personal rights. Nothing can give the donor legal authority over their facsimile unless the donor has requested a facsimile to raise as their own child. In the latter case, the donor is granted legal recognition of a culturally appropriate parent-offspring relationship, commensurate with all relevant mores, traditions, and legal rights. 

For all intents and purposes – legally, subjectively, practically – whole-body clones are individuals distinct from their donor. They are people, with their own legal rights and entitlements. The only way they differ from “natural-born” persons is that their genetic data is identical to that of their donor; they are otherwise indistinguishable. 

Partial cloning is commonly used for medical purposes. Tissue, major organs, viable follicles, limbs, and bodily fluids – nothing capable of conscious or unconscious thought – are all regularly cloned to provide donors with exact-match replacements. In this context, too, donors must provide informed consent as defined by their culture or state before this type of cloning is allowed. 

Modern perceptions of clones are strongly weighted by the echoes and artifacts of recent history.

[[DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS|DoJ/HR]]’s Facsimile Rights Department frequently handles legal claims from facsimile persons and oversees cloning facilities, spot checks, and maintenance of public genetic proof data. Liberator teams commonly run point on regulation and enforcement actions targeting underground flash-cloning sites. PCs that are facsimile persons will likely have some knowledge of their genetic donor.

# Flash Clones 
#update
In times of crisis, or when a rush order needed to be filled, so-called “flash” clones were created instead6. Grown in artificial birthing chambers, flash clones could be cultivated from zygote to physically mature adult in less than five years. While flash-clone creation started from the same basis as facsimile clones – donated genetic material – the accelerated growth process that flash clones underwent was traumatic and prone to error. While facsimile clones have the duration of a natural life to learn, grow, and form their own subjectivity, flash clones were created for a task – filling out the ranks of armed forces, or replacing a depleted mining corps – and thus were considered to be disposable once the immediate task that required their production was accomplished. 

Because of the traumatic growth and cognition-conditioning processes involved in flash-cloning, flash clones were prone to rapid onset degenerative diseases, atypical neurogenesis, a wide range of anomalous tumors, catastrophic immunodeficiencies, and many other chronic, terminal genetic illnesses. But the majority of people created in flash-cloning facilities did not live long enough to suffer the effects of the process that birthed them; the process was designed to churn out human bodies with speed, not accuracy, and to assign them one task with little regard for their rights, decency, or humanity. [[Third Committee|Third‐ Comm]] rejected whole-subjectivity flash-cloning outright as a core assumption of its Utopian Pillars. 

A process influenced by the flash-cloning technologies developed during the Neo-Anthropocene Period (“rapid cloning”) still takes place, but it is reserved for medical constituent-tissue cloning: simple procedures where limbs, gross tissue, digits, or organs are needed to rectify a stable patient’s physical trauma. The materials needed to graft new skin after a burn, or transplant perfect-match organs and limbs where they have been severed or damaged, for example, – can be grown within hours of genetic mapping. 

The cloning methods of old still exist in some places, filling in the gray spaces of legality and morality. Despite the outlawing of whole-body flash-cloning, it is allegedly practiced by [[Harrison Armory]] and a number of the larger Baronic houses. Progressive [[Third Committee|ThirdComm]] members regularly urge action to fulfill [[``Union|Union]]’s mandate and often task [[DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS|DoJ/HR]] with enforcing the ban against smaller targets. Meanwhile, the Armory and the [[Karrakin Trade Baronies|Baronies]] argue that their flash-cloning methods are similar to those that came before in name only, and that their processes are much safer.

Flash-clone PCs tend to be citizens (to some degree) of [[Harrison Armory]] or subjects of a Karrakin trade baron. Their natural lifespan may or may not be truncated as a result of the flash-cloning process. PCs that are flash clones from somewhere other than the Armory or the [[Karrakin Trade Baronies|Baronies]] might face more complications, and will likely be regarded as sympathetic witnesses in [[UNION NAVAL DEPARTMENT|UN]] and [[DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS|DoJ/HR]] investigations.

# Clones under SeccComm
#update

Under the [[Second Committee]], facsimile clones were a popular option for states, corporations, and other bodies in need of labor, constituents, or a ready supply of soldiers. The Anthrochauvinist government viewed clones not as individual persons, but as the legal property of their donors – a residual patriarchal construct that identified donors as the “progenitors” of their offspring, giving them full legal authority over beings that would not have existed without the donor’s intervention.

Essentially, facsimile clones – to say nothing of flash clones, explained in the following paragraphs – were second-class persons. Their individuality was recognized, but their legal rights were truncated on the basis that they were the results of “investments” made by their progenitors. Thus, they could be pressed into military, labor, or other dangerous services, with their owners only mandated to provide the bare minimum level of care – enough to ensure they didn’t die of hunger, thirst, or “reasonably preventable illness or exposure”.

Under SecComm, facsimile clones were widely used throughout the galaxy by state and private militaries, with specific martial traits emphasized by geneticists; at the same time, facsimiles conditioned in the company schools of corpro-states were used to staff many “soft” labor positions. In the [[Karrakin Trade Baronies|Baronies]] particularly, facsimiles often occupied the highest echelons of society as ideal heirs, doubles, and tokens for the trade of pleasure or favors.

## Complications
(Page 83, Core Book)

While facsimile clones suffer fewer physical complications than flash clones, subjectivity override – whether applied to a facsimile or flash clone – is an experimental process that always creates complications, personal and social. 

Unless the other members of a character’s team know that subjectivity override is possible, it’s going to be a hell of a surprise to see their comrade back from the dead. As for the revivified pilot themselves, they might have to wrestle with the “gap” in their memory. This “gap” necessarily means they don’t remember any events or interactions after the beginning of the session in which they died, although they keep all LL advancement.

It is up to the player whether they want to bring a slain character back as a subjectivity-override clone, or if they simply want to make a new character. It’s important to remember that even if a clone has had a subjectivity override, this does not mean that they are the same person as the character who died: they look the same and share an imprint of the deceased’s memories, drawing from them to act in novel situations; the original pilot who was killed is dead, their consciousness ended, forever. 
By default, the following conditions apply to both facsimile- and flash-cloned characters, but they can be tweaked by the GM as needed:
	•Cloned characters can’t join a mission in progress.
	•Flash-cloned characters always come back with a quirk (see below).
	•Additional cloning and subjectivity imprinting adds further quirks.


## Quirks
(Page 83, Core Book)

Quirks can be physical or mental in nature, but they’re always complicating. Whatever they are, they should offer story hooks or create interesting narrative situations – they don’t have significant gameplay effects.

Optionally, quirks might also be given to characters who go DOWN AND OUT – representing the lingering trauma of such a close encounter with death – or to characters who have died and been brought back to life by the GM’s discretion or a twist in the narrative.

If you want to roll for a random quirk, you can roll 1d20 or choose from the below chart. You can use these as examples for designing quirks of your own if you want to decide on a custom quirk with your GM.
