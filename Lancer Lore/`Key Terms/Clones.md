Exceptional pilots – especially lancers – represent tremendous investments in hardware and training; as such, they tend to have powerful, well-connected patrons with an interest in maintaining their investments. It’s no surprise, then, that technologies exist to replace deceased pilots with subjective [[Clones#Facsimile Clones|facsimiles]] or – if time doesn't permit – to create imperfect, [[Clones#Flashgrown|flashgrown]] genetic clones.

Unique-subjectivity, natural-life [[Clones#Facsimile Clones|“facsimile”]] clones are their own people – legally, culturally, and cognitively – and are common throughout the galaxy (in terrestrial world colonization, for example, first- and second generation cloning is the norm). [[Clones#Flash Clones|Flash clones]] are far less common, as the practice is broadly unlawful. Subjectivity override of either a flash or facsimile clone is exceedingly rare.

Growing a body is easy; it is a very different thing – and much more fraught – to override a <u>clone’s</u> natural subjectivity with the cobbled-together cognitive profile of the deceased. [[Clones#Facsimile Clones|Facsimile]] subjectivity cloning is incredibly expensive, subject to intense scrutiny, and restricted to approved entities; Unless a pilot is lucky enough to work for an organization with [[``Union|Union's]] express sanction to run one of these rare and arguably unethical cloning programs, any cloning that does take place is probably unlawful.

# Clones under SeccComm

Under the [[Second Committee]], facsimile clones were a popular option for states, corporations, and other bodies in need of labor, constituents, or a ready supply of soldiers. The Anthrochauvinist government viewed clones not as individual persons, but as the legal property of their donors – a residual patriarchal construct that identified donors as the “progenitors” of their offspring, giving them full legal authority over beings that would not have existed without the donor’s intervention.

Essentially, facsimile clones – to say nothing of flash clones, explained in the following paragraphs – were second-class persons. Their individuality was recognized, but their legal rights were truncated on the basis that they were the results of “investments” made by their progenitors. Thus, they could be pressed into military, labor, or other dangerous services, with their owners only mandated to provide the bare minimum level of care – enough to ensure they didn’t die of hunger, thirst, or “reasonably preventable illness or exposure”.

Under SecComm, facsimile clones were widely used throughout the galaxy by state and private militaries, with specific martial traits emphasized by geneticists; at the same time, facsimiles conditioned in the company schools of corpro-states were used to staff many “soft” labor positions. In the [[New Karrakin Trade Baronies|Baronies]] particularly, facsimiles often occupied the highest echelons of society as ideal heirs, doubles, and tokens for the trade of pleasure or favors.

## Complications
(Page 83, Core Book)

While facsimile clones suffer fewer physical complications than flash clones, subjectivity override – whether applied to a facsimile or flash clone – is an experimental process that always creates complications, personal and social. 

Unless the other members of a character’s team know that subjectivity override is possible, it’s going to be a hell of a surprise to see their comrade back from the dead. As for the revivified pilot themselves, they might have to wrestle with the “gap” in their memory. This “gap” necessarily means they don’t remember any events or interactions after the beginning of the session in which they died, although they keep all LL advancement.

It is up to the player whether they want to bring a slain character back as a subjectivity-override clone, or if they simply want to make a new character. It’s important to remember that even if a clone has had a subjectivity override, this does not mean that they are the same person as the character who died: they look the same and share an imprint of the deceased’s memories, drawing from them to act in novel situations; the original pilot who was killed is dead, their consciousness ended, forever. 
By default, the following conditions apply to both facsimile- and flash-cloned characters, but they can be tweaked by the GM as needed:
	•Cloned characters can’t join a mission in progress.
	•Flash-cloned characters always come back with a quirk (see below).
	•Additional cloning and subjectivity imprinting adds further quirks.


## Quirks
(Page 83, Core Book)

Quirks can be physical or mental in nature, but they’re always complicating. Whatever they are, they should offer story hooks or create interesting narrative situations – they don’t have significant gameplay effects.

Optionally, quirks might also be given to characters who go DOWN AND OUT – representing the lingering trauma of such a close encounter with death – or to characters who have died and been brought back to life by the GM’s discretion or a twist in the narrative.

If you want to roll for a random quirk, you can roll 1d20 or choose from the below chart. You can use these as examples for designing quirks of your own if you want to decide on a custom quirk with your GM.
