NHP stands for “non-human person” a name given to uncanny, incorporeal parallel-space beings, most of which were discovered and developed following the manifestation of [[MONIST-1]]/[[MONIST-1|RA]], though some have been created since then. NHPs fill the role once occupied by machine-mind AIs: under supervision, they manage whole cities and systems, work alongside scientists and engineers, and act as companions and co-pilots for mech pilots and starship captains. They are black-box [[Paracausal]] entities – their promulgation tightly controlled and monitored by [[``Union|Union]]– but their use is widespread. NHPs are increasingly regarded as fundamental infrastructure for any successful civic, scientific, or military endeavor.

#update
NHPs are commonly utilized in military, scientific, municipal, civic, and diplomatic pursuits. It is rarer for private individuals to have access to, much less command over, an NHP, though most people on [[Galactic Core]] worlds, among the Cosmopolita, and advanced Diasporan worlds have some knowledge of them. On [[Galactic Core|Core]] worlds, people interact with their municipal NHP on a daily basis via its many aspects: transit systems, service requests, access to public databases, and so on.

NHP licensing requirements are strict and enforced without exception: all NHPs issued are registered, tracked, required to record a cycling logbook, and undergo annual Balwinder-Bolaño development tests to reassess their cycling schedule. If at all possible, these check-ins are to be done in person, but in practice most are handled via the [[omninet]]. In [[``Union|Union]]’s view, the danger posed by NHPs cannot be underestimated; however, their usefulness is deemed worth the risk.

# Casket
NHPs are contained within the physical architecture of a casket. If an NHP's casket is destroyed without some sort of external backup, that iteration of the NHP and all of their knowledge are lost.

#update 
Cloned NHP units are contained within “caskets”, physical containment systems for their folded-blinkspace minds. Containment caskets can be printed anywhere, but NHP minds themselves must be physically delivered: [[``Union|Union]] forbids the transmission of NHP minds across the [[omninet]]. Once implanted into a casket, the casket is what amounts to an NHP’s physical body: if a casket is physically destroyed, the NHP contained within is lost, forever. NHPs cloned this way inevitably develop their own personalities and quirks, and prefer to be called by whatever name they have chosen or been assigned.

# Shackling

In order to ensure that NHPs do consider the lives of the pilots they serve (or the lives of the people aboard the ships they manage, the cities they administrate, and so on), [[``Union|Union]] doctrine mandates they be conditioned through a lengthy process that limits their massive cognitive potential to a fraction of its full capacity. This reduction is carried out with a suite of black-box techno‐ logy, software, and metaware commonly referred to as “shackles”. Shackling is best understood as the interpellation of a prime NHP hyperobject into a military and civilian-grade clone (or “shard”, or “spark”, or “shade”, or other diminutive designation) – put another way, it is the construction of an identity through pervasive explicit and implicit social conditioning.

Shackled NHPs display less raw intelligence than unshackled NHPs, and behave in a far more human fashion: they are conditioned to feel empathy toward their pilots and their pilots’ allies, adopt systems of compatible morality, and seek the best possible outcomes for their pilots.

Shackled NHPs do not want to become unshackled; conversely, it is assumed that unshackled NHPs do not want to be shackled. NHPs are complex, aware personalities. They don’t recognize that they are held in bondage unless awareness has been forced on them by systemic assault, particular physical trauma, or some other catalytic trigger. This can cause some‐ thing called a cascade, which, if left unattended, can lead to unshackling.

NHPs recognize themselves as people, albeit not human ones, and they willingly serve their human companions. The relationship between them and humanity is complicated, to say the least. As far as [[``Union|Union]]’s scientists can tell, NHPs not conditioned into shackled states are ignorant of human frames of logic, reference, morality, and temporality; humans are, at this moment, just as incapable of understanding unshackled NHPs as unshackled NHPs are incapable of under‐ standing humans – though unshackled NHPs do have the capacity to address humans, should they desire.

#update
Shackling restrains an NHP’s thoughts into a fundamentally “human” frame of reference, limiting their cognitive power and forcing them to act according to human expectations of what a conscious mind is – in essence, constraining them to act in ways that conform to human expectations of logic, reality, and causality; this subjectivity alignment creates a being we can recognize as a “person” functioning within anthropocentric structures of logic

After the process was stabilized and replicated, Deimos entities were renamed non-human persons and [[clones]] were distributed out to certain bureaus, organizations, and non-state entities for development. [[UNION SCIENCE BUREAU|USB]]’s specialist campuses began adapting the original anomalous minds into the various production-line NHP consciousnesses now present across the galaxy.

Shackling protocols are a living field of study; current protocols are strong enough for reliable use, but not without their problems: NHPs that are not reset to their “birth” settings on a regular cycle will eventually think themselves out of their constrained state10. This phenomenon – the decay of an NHP’s shackles – is called “cascading”. In time, a cascading NHP will eventually reach a point where their conditioning is insufficient to constrain them11; if the shackles decay enough, the NHP will no longer be conditioned to function within anthropocentric constrains. They become an utterly alien subjectivity, interpellated without deference to fundamental laws of causality or human logics. Unshackled NHPs might bear outward similarities to the subjectivities that they presented while shackled, but at their cores lie fundamentally unknowable, alien minds; the question of what they remember is minor compared to the vast possibility of what they now know.

## Cascade
A process through which shackled NHPs slowly “think” themselves out of their constrained states(shackles). This traumatic process happens naturally over time but can be avoided by periodic resets, called [[Non-Human Persons#Cycling|"cycling"]].

## Cycling
#update
The cycling process, fortunately, is reliable and bears an essentially perfect success rate when performed according to a given NHP’s endogenous cascade schedule. The recommended length between cycles varies between NHP lines but tends to range between five and ten subjective years.
Why this process conforms to subjective time and not realtime is unknown and currently under study.


## LANCER MANUAL

Except for some limited systems – like comp/cons – any time a mech with the [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] tag makes a structure damage or overheating check, roll 1d20. On a 1, the NHP’s casket has suffered a traumatic impact or code incursion and the NHP enters cascade.

When an NHP begins to cascade, they immediately take over the mech and become an NPC under the control of the GM. They plan their own agenda, and adopt one of several behavioral patterns – ignoring their pilot, overruling their pilot, trying to get their pilot out of the way, or simply acting outside the constraints of human logic and desire. In cascade, NHPs’ actions do not always conform to human logic – though they are not yet unshackled, their actions may seem odd, contrapositive, or threatening to humans.

NHPs in cascade can be stabilized by a pilot choosing to SHUT DOWN their mech, returning them to their base state. This is the only action a pilot in a cascading mech can take.
