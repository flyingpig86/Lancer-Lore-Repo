aliases: [NHP,NHPs]

NHP stands for “non-human person” a name given to uncanny, incorporeal parallel-space beings, most of which were discovered and developed following the manifestation of [[MONIST-1]]/[[MONIST-1|RA]], though some have been created since then. NHPs fill the role once occupied by machine-mind AIs: under supervision, they manage whole cities and systems, work alongside scientists and engineers, and act as companions and co-pilots for mech pilots and starship captains. They are black-box [[Paracausal]] entities – their promulgation tightly controlled and monitored by [[``Union|Union]]– but their use is widespread. NHPs are increasingly regarded as fundamental infrastructure for any successful civic, scientific, or military endeavor.

# Casket
NHPs are contained within the physical architecture of a casket. If an NHP's casket is destroyed without some sort of external backup, that iteration of the NHP and all of their knowledge are lost.

# Shackling

In order to ensure that NHPs do consider the lives of the pilots they serve (or the lives of the people aboard the ships they manage, the cities they administrate, and so on), [[``Union|Union]] doctrine mandates they be conditioned through a lengthy process that limits their massive cognitive potential to a fraction of its full capacity. This reduction is carried out with a suite of black-box techno‐ logy, software, and metaware commonly referred to as “shackles”. Shackling is best understood as the interpellation of a prime NHP hyperobject into a military and civilian-grade clone (or “shard”, or “spark”, or “shade”, or other diminutive designation) – put another way, it is the construction of an identity through pervasive explicit and implicit social conditioning.

Shackled NHPs display less raw intelligence than unshackled NHPs, and behave in a far more human fashion: they are conditioned to feel empathy toward their pilots and their pilots’ allies, adopt systems of compatible morality, and seek the best possible outcomes for their pilots.

Shackled NHPs do not want to become unshackled; conversely, it is assumed that unshackled NHPs do not want to be shackled. NHPs are complex, aware personalities. They don’t recognize that they are held in bondage unless awareness has been forced on them by systemic assault, particular physical trauma, or some other catalytic trigger. This can cause some‐ thing called a cascade, which, if left unattended, can lead to unshackling.

NHPs recognize themselves as people, albeit not human ones, and they willingly serve their human companions. The relationship between them and humanity is complicated, to say the least. As far as [[``Union|Union]]’s scientists can tell, NHPs not conditioned into shackled states are ignorant of human frames of logic, reference, morality, and temporality; humans are, at this moment, just as incapable of understanding unshackled NHPs as unshackled NHPs are incapable of under‐ standing humans – though unshackled NHPs do have the capacity to address humans, should they desire.

## Cascade
A process through which shackled NHPs slowly “think” themselves out of their constrained states(shackles). This traumatic process happens naturally over time but can be avoided by periodic resets, called [[Non-Human Persons#Cycling|"cycling"]].

Except for some limited systems – like comp/cons – any time a mech with the [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] tag makes a structure damage or overheating check, roll 1d20. On a 1, the NHP’s casket has suffered a traumatic impact or code incursion and the NHP enters cascade.

When an NHP begins to cascade, they immediately take over the mech and become an NPC under the control of the GM. They plan their own agenda, and adopt one of several behavioral patterns – ignoring their pilot, overruling their pilot, trying to get their pilot out of the way, or simply acting outside the constraints of human logic and desire. In cascade, NHPs’ actions do not always conform to human logic – though they are not yet unshackled, their actions may seem odd, contrapositive, or threatening to humans.

NHPs in cascade can be stabilized by a pilot choosing to SHUT DOWN their mech, returning them to their base state. This is the only action a pilot in a cascading mech can take.
