A Cosmopolitan is a person who lives the majority of their life in {{interstellar transit}} and keeps their ship as their home. [[Interstellar travel]] in Lancer occurs at or near the speed of light; existence at this relative speed necessarily means that Cosmopolitan humans live outside of the course of “real” time. To the humans of the [[Diasporans|Diaspora]] and the [[Galactic Core|Core]], these <u><u>Cosmopolitans</u></u> are almost eternal, seeming to live for generations. The histories, stories, and cultures of <u>Cosmopolitans</u> are separate from the bulk of humanity, their lives defined in relation and contrast to the windows of time they witness when they drop out of {{nearlight}}. To observers, the Cosmopolitan life might seem lonely or ahistorical, but <u>Cosmopolitans</u> have rich and storied histories, shared culture, and a vision of humanity as a whole that few others have access to or the ability to witness.
