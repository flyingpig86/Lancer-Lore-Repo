Filling the lonely void is the <u>omninet</u>, a data-sharing network built off the blink that connects every computer, every server – everything – to everything else. The <u>omninet</u> is much more than a way to send messages or a means for people on far-flung worlds to read the galaxy’s news; it overlays all human communications, facilitating government, industry, culture, and realms more esoteric still. Data is the new wealth, and the <u>omninet</u> means that all wealth can be shared.
