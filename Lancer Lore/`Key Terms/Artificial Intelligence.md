AIs fall into two categories: companion/concierge assistant units, better known as comp/cons, and non- human persons ([[Non-Human Persons|NHPs]]). A comp/con is an advanced software suite, obedient solely to its licensee; [[Non-Human Persons|NHPs]], on the other hand, are sentient.

# Comp/Cons
Companion/concierge units, typically shortened to “comp/cons” (less common, but also used are “cc” and “2c”), are the most common machine minds. On [[Galactic Core|Core]] worlds and throughout developed Diasporan worlds, most adults to carry around pocket-sized comp/con-enabled devices – commonly called “slates” on account of their appearance – and use them for everyday tasks: day-planning, calling friends and family, playing games, navigation, listening to music, watching [[omninet]] and local network news and entertainment broadcasts, engaging in social media, and so on. These devices are not conscious in any way, but their processing power and “intelligence” are orders of magnitude beyond those of any given human. They are powerful, operator-oriented personal computers – no more, no less. Their architecture features no paracausal elements, and they do not require shackling or cycling.

Comp/cons are configured to adapt to their owner’s routines and personality, extrapolating their own personalities based on internal psychological profiling of their users. A comp/con can convincingly approximate a personal assistant but will show its artificiality when faced with novel situations.

## Smart Weaponry
Smart weapons are built on the same basic architecture as comp/cons, but feature significant upgrades to their processing power and an added emphasis on both friend-or-foe identification and morality/ethics praxis-programming.

There are two primary types of smart weapons: copy drives and comp/con wingmen.

Copy drive weapons incorporate 1+n cc units that employ rapid partitioning, data cloning, and tethered separation: when fired, the “prime” drive partitions, flashcloning itself onto the projectile while its prime copy remains onboard the host weapon. This tethers the prime and clone units through a wireless omninet connection. As it travels, the clone feeds telemetry and other essential data back to the prime unit, which writes new clones onto each subsequent projectile, adjusting flight plans and other parameters in real time. Deep theory on the subjective experience of copy drives is limited and interpersonal interaction with prime units is rare. They are typically programmed without communication functions and don’t interact directly with the person wielding the weapon. That said, with certain isolation protocols removed or post-market communications architecture installed, some models can interact with their operators via text or simple spoken messages.

Comp/con wingmen are the user-facing equivalent of military administrative comp/cons. Integrated with a specific weapon or system, their chief purpose is to maintain and operate their host-system within operating parameters established by the pilot or factory defaults. To that end, like civilian comp/cons, they develop personalities appropriate to their users, their environments, and the tactical roles in which they are most often employed.

Like civilian comp/con units, neither copy drives nor comp/con wingmen require shackling or cycling.

Players can determine the general disposition and personality of their installed [[Non-Human Persons|NHPs]], but while they’re agreeable to commands, pilots have much more conversational relationships with them than they do with comp/con units.

## Handing Over Control
Mechs can only have one system with the AI tag installed at a time. If a mech has the AI tag, its player can choose to give control of the mech to the AI as a protocol, freeing the pilot to take other actions. The pilot can’t use the mech to take any actions or reactions until they take control again, but the AI gains its own set of actions and reactions. The AI acts on the same turn as the pilot. AIs don’t benefit from the pilot’s talents or other features, but otherwise operate as normal. 

At the start of the player’s subsequent turns, control can be returned to the pilot as long as they are physically inside their mech.
