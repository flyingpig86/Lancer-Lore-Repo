aliases: [AI]

AIs fall into two categories: companion/concierge assistant units, better known as comp/cons, and non- human persons ([[Non-Human Persons|NHPs]]). A comp/con is an advanced software suite, obedient solely to its licensee; [[Non-Human Persons|NHPs]], on the other hand, are sentient.

Players can determine the general disposition and personality of their installed [[Non-Human Persons|NHPs]], but while they’re agreeable to commands, pilots have much more conversational relationships with them than they do with comp/con units.

## Handing Over Control
Mechs can only have one system with the AI tag installed at a time. If a mech has the AI tag, its player can choose to give control of the mech to the AI as a protocol, freeing the pilot to take other actions. The pilot can’t use the mech to take any actions or reactions until they take control again, but the AI gains its own set of actions and reactions. The AI acts on the same turn as the pilot. AIs don’t benefit from the pilot’s talents or other features, but otherwise operate as normal. 

At the start of the player’s subsequent turns, control can be returned to the pilot as long as they are physically inside their mech.
