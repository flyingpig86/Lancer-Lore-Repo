The Châus are a hardscrabble farming family with several homesteads around Liu Maize. Matriarchs Maggie and Weiyi Châu arrived in Evergreen twenty years after the colony’s founding on a jury-rigged hauling skiff with barely enough fuel to get them to the colony. They were married in Evergreen and spent several years working odd construction jobs around the colony before their noncitizen status was discovered and they were expelled.
