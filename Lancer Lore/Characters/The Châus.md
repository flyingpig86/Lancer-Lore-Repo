The Châus are a hardscrabble farming family with several homesteads around Liu Maize. Matriarchs Maggie and Weiyi Châu arrived in [[Evergreen]] twenty years after the colony’s founding on a jury-rigged hauling skiff with barely enough fuel to get them to the colony. They were married in [[Evergreen]] and spent several years working odd construction jobs around the colony before their noncitizen status was discovered and they were expelled.

Not to be deterred, they’ve had ten children over the thirty years since and founded a prosperous root farming and distillation business, selling to traders, militia, and colonists for colony requisition access for necessary supplies and luxuries. They have no intention of returning to [[Evergreen]] and the family generally shuns the colony.

Their son, Albert, his wife Nora, and their several children are holed up in the farmhouse.
