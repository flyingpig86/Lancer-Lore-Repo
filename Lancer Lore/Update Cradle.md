# Other Worlds within the Sol System
The other terrestrial worlds of the Andes Line – Mercury, Venus, and Mars, are developed and populated. Like their gaseous sisters, they also act as proving grounds for technologies developed by [[GENERAL MASSIVE SYSTEMS|GMS]] and [[``Union|Union]].


## Venus
Venus is an archive world. Its surface is scattered with populated stations meant for rotational work and field research rather than long-term occupation. The planet hasn’t been terraformed and remains hostile to human life outside of its vast, subterranean archives. [[``Union|Union]]’s prime [[Non-Human Persons|NHPs]] are kept on Venus, entombed beneath the massive pressure of the world’s inhospitable atmosphere for study since the Deimos Event. Its population centers, Morningstar and Venera Final, are kept suspended in the world's upper atmosphere by a combination of downwell anchors, massive balloons, and orbital ballast.
