The Sagarmatha is of an older pattern than the [[GMS Standard Pattern 1|Everest]], sturdier and bulkier by necessity more than design. It is seen as somewhat antiquated through the lens of modern manufacturing standards. Nevertheless, it enjoys some use in border colonies, in the [[Karrakin Trade Baronies|Baronies]], and with the [[Albatross]].
