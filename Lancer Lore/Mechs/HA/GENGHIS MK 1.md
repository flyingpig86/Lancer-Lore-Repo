Though the Genghis Mk I is classified as a Harrison Armory FRAME for gameplay purposes, the original Genghis models were based on upscaled SecComm power armor and are technically GMS frames. Today, they are only compatible with the HA Genghis license due to a last-ditch tech partition by SecComm partisans in the latter stages of the revolution. 

These old-pattern Genghis mechs are buried all over Hercynia in various states of disrepair and carnage. They are a grim reminder of the carnage that once took place here. Unlike the Mk II, with its sleeker, slimmer frame, the Mk I is much more brutal in its simplicity â€“ mass produced, a crude weapon.
