Though the Genghis Mk I is classified as a [[Harrison Armory]] FRAME for gameplay purposes, the original Genghis models were based on upscaled SecComm power armor and are technically [[GENERAL MASSIVE SYSTEMS|GMS]] frames. Today, they are only compatible with the [[HARRISON ARMORY|HA]] Genghis license due to a last-ditch tech partition by SecComm partisans in the latter stages of the revolution. 

These old-pattern Genghis mechs are buried all over [[Hercynia]] in various states of disrepair and carnage. They are a grim reminder of the carnage that once took place here. Unlike the Mk II, with its sleeker, slimmer frame, the Mk I is much more brutal in its simplicity â€“ mass produced, a crude weapon.
