The Barbarossa is [[Harrison Armory]]’s most massive frame to date, built, per the orders of Harrison II, to “stand as the unstoppable image of Harrison I” and to carry the heaviest of weapons and equipment the Armory offers. Standing nearly thirteen meters tall, it is an unsubtle beast of a mech, inspiring terror in enemies and awe in allies. The Barbarossa can mount weapons suitable for engaging toe-to-toe with gunboats and low-gross tonnage subline vessels; due to its size and slow maneuverability, it is often employed in low-gravity engagements where mass is less of a concern.

The Barbarossa is a popular target for Purview essayists, who have been known to remark on the drawbacks that come with its size and how, as a result, it is a perfect stand-in for their political enemies.

APOCALYPSE RAIL
	*Fresh from the Armory’s dayside research and development campus, the LGC-04 “Apocalypse Rail” is an exponential gravitic catapult – a to-scale test product pushed to licensed pilots for field trials as part of the Armory’s ongoing Plenary Beach Magnitude Weapons Test Project.
	Distinct from current logarithmic short- or long-spool ship-to-ship weapons (kinetic or energetic/particular), this new platform taps into the Armory’s current gravitic research to exponentially charge and distribute a kinetic payload downrange. This increase in potential energy loading and decrease in total charge time comes at the cost of stability: where the logarithmic spool cannon is stable and shock-resistant, the exponential gravitic catapult is prone to destabilization. For the time being, built-in failsafes will trigger in the event of sudden traumatic destabilization to prevent detonation of the system, resetting any charging process underway at the time of the shock.
	The LGC-04 “Apocalypse Rail” system is scaled considerably down from its intended operational role – that is, replacing capital ship spinal spool cannons – in order to effect the accumulation of live data for use in improving the system prior to naval adoption.*
