The Barbarossa is Harrison Armory’s most massive frame to date, built, per the orders of Harrison II, to “stand as the unstoppable image of Harrison I” and to carry the heaviest of weapons and equipment the Armory offers. Standing nearly thirteen meters tall, it is an unsubtle beast of a mech, inspiring terror in enemies and awe in allies. The Barbarossa can mount weapons suitable for engaging toe-to-toe with gunboats and low-gross tonnage subline vessels; due to its size and slow maneuverability, it is often employed in low-gravity engagements where mass is less of a concern.

The Barbarossa is a popular target for Purview essayists, who have been known to remark on the drawbacks that come with its size and how, as a result, it is a perfect stand-in for their political enemies.
