The Swallowtail is Smith-Shimano’s primary long-range scouting and firesupport platform, built for rapid and sustained ranging across hostile, volatile environments. Built for long-term sustainability, it can operate in unstable environs for months and maximize its survivability by adjusting its operating efficiency on the fly. Each unit has an integrated cloak and a suite of predictive choral intelligences that coordinate its highly developed sensor systems to rapidly simulate and predict tactical developments – sometimes before they even occur.

The Swallowtail’s base model, the SW-01, is one of SSC’s few mass-produced lines – the entry-level BELLA CIAO model. Built without a cloaking field and uparmored to address direct security requirements, the SW-01 is especially popular among the rank and file troopers of Constellar Security forces.

CLOUDSCOUT TACSIM SWARMS
	*Cloudscout TACSIM Swarms are packets of networked microsensors, launched in nonlethal mortar canisters that detonate high above the battlefield. Once seeded, the swarm generates a TACSIM program that begins to run brevity cycles: tight, contained simulations of tactical possibility. Probability results are then fed to the Swallowtail’s choir processors, which in turn feed it to the pilot and networked squad members, ensuring a high probability of successful outcomes.*
