The Swallowtail is Smith-Shimano’s primary long-range scouting and firesupport platform, built for rapid and sustained ranging across hostile, volatile environments. Built for long-term sustainability, it can operate in unstable environs for months and maximize its survivability by adjusting its operating efficiency on the fly. Each unit has an integrated cloak and a suite of predictive choral intelligences that coordinate its highly developed sensor systems to rapidly simulate and predict tactical developments – sometimes before they even occur.

The Swallowtail’s base model, the SW-01, is one of [[SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO|SSC]]’s few mass-produced lines – the entry-level BELLA CIAO model. Built without a cloaking field and uparmored to address direct security requirements, the SW-01 is especially popular among the rank and file troopers of Constellar Security forces.

CLOUDSCOUT TACSIM SWARMS
	*Cloudscout TACSIM Swarms are packets of networked microsensors, launched in nonlethal mortar canisters that detonate high above the battlefield. Once seeded, the swarm generates a TACSIM program that begins to run brevity cycles: tight, contained simulations of tactical possibility. Probability results are then fed to the Swallowtail’s choir processors, which in turn feed it to the pilot and networked squad members, ensuring a high probability of successful outcomes.*

Lotus Projector
	*Mech-mounted Lotus Projectors are designed to launch small, actively camouflaged scout drones. The projector fires the single-use drones at subsonic speeds in bursts of ten, blanketing a wide area in order to relay information about terrain and targets within.*

Markerlight
	*“Out, damned spot! Out, I say! – One, two. Why, then, ‘tis time to do’t. Hell is murky! – Fie, my lord, fie! A soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?”
	– Shakespeare, Macbeth, act 5, sc. 1.*

Oracle LMG-I
	*The Oracle Indirect Light Machine Gun (designated O/LMG-I) packs a subsentient, high-volume DOWNPOUR static quad-barrel system into a single cylinder typically installed on the dorsal panel of a chassis. Paired with a firing system, the Oracle is capable of directing persistent defilade-ignorant kinetic fire at targets.*

Retractable Profile
	*The hallmark of a well thought out mech frame is the opportunity for pilots to adapt their stock models to the specifications of the environments in which they operate. A retractable profile enables on-the-fly removal of extraneous protrusions, tuning of broadcast software, and masking of heat signatures – all serving to reduce optical and scanner signatures.*


ATHENA-Class NHP
	*Smith-Shimano’s ATHENA is the pinnacle of total hyperspectral environmental facsimiles. Through a combination of unfettered [[omninet]] access, hyperspectral relays fired out from a Cloudscout TACSIM projector, sub-networked squadmates, and active/hostile intrusion protocols, ATHENA bootstraps a near-flawless reconstruction of the immediate environment around its host core. ATHENA is unparalleled in its processing power, and with this reconstructed environment, it provides trustworthy, accurate advice to pilots in need of strategic counsel.*
	*ATHENA [[clones]] tend to be patient, cautious, and measured in their relations with their pilots.*

LB/OC Cloaking Field
	*[[SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO|SSC]]’s mil-spec cloaking field is the result of extensive experimentation in cooling and light-reflecting sciences. Born from a need to reflect harmful radiation away from ships and EVA modules in deep space, the Lightbend/Overcloak (LB/OC) cloaking field is often used by rangers and long-patrol scout pilots to ensure not only radiation protection, but optical concealment as well. The lightand radiation-bending properties of the LB/OC conceals anything inside of its projected bubble from sensor suites and optical spotting.*
