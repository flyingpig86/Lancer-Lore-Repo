The Black Witch is the flagship model of [[SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO|SSC]]’s LUX-Iconic line of frames, on paper meant to compete with [[Harrison Armory]]’s dominance in the field of cutting-edge gravity and electromagnetic manipulation. Utilizing the newest technologies developed by [[SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO|SSC]]’s Exotic Materials Group, the Black Witch is a fearsome area-control platform, often fielded in support of heavier mechs engaged in direct combat.

With a slim profile and strong defensive systems, the Black Witch is especially popular among the wealthier houses of the [[Karrakin Trade Baronies]], who often place multiple orders to outfit their personal guards and house company officers. Next to internally produced Baronic frames, the Black Witch (alongside other [[SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO|SSC]] LUX-Iconic models) is the most popular [[SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO|SSC]] chassis throughout noble Karrakin space.

MAGNETIC FIELD PROJECTOR
	Magnetic field generators are a portable and field-deployable variation on typical magnetic defense technologies. When activated, they create a magnetic bubble that traps all incoming ferrous projectiles. The strength of the field is so great that it can even draw mechs to its center. When the field is dispersed or its solid-state battery burns out – a feature, not a flaw – the field undergoes a sudden catastrophic implosion, drawing all captured projectiles to a point at the center of the bubble.

Ferrous Lash
	Initially developed as a nonlethal crowdsuppression device, the Ferrous Lash is a far more complex and dangerous device in the hands of the right pilot. The Lash consists of a series of integrated launchers that detonate payloads of fastcongealing ferrofluids that restrain their targets. Tuned to the correct frequency, these proprietary ferrofluid blends form into rudimentary ambulatory segments, pulling their hosts back towards the one wielding the Lash.

Magnetic Cannon
	[[SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO|SSC]]’s magnetic cannon is a first from the Exotic Materials Group: an aperturefocused electromagnetic projection beam that uses intense pulses of magnetic energy to disrupt and damage hardware. Targets caught in the beam of a magnetic cannon suffer additional damage to their software as massive systemic stress is inflicted on sensitive components.

ICEOUT Drone
	[[SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO|SSC]]’s ICEOUT drone is a response to increasing reliance on hostile system scans for accurate targeting. By blanketing a mech’s systems in layers of digital defilade, mirroring, spoofing, and redirection, an ICEOUT drone can effectively disappear or disincorporate it from hostile scans. ICEOUT drones only make their operator system-invisible, however; they remain visible with optics

Perimeter Command Plate
	The Exotic Materials Group developed the Perimeter Command Plate to extend the area of the Black Witch’s zone of control. Utilizing single-pattern flash printers, the Black Witch prints a broad, circular plate seeded with electromagnetic projectors. Although the plates are intended to be disposable, Black Witch pilots often grow attached to their “familiars” and request their flash-printers create personalized plates.

Black ICE Module
	Black ICE modules are defensive systems packaged standard with the Black Witch fleets used by [[SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO|SSC]]'s own internal security forces. They project a bubble of WHITECELL code that analyzes incoming hostile script and structures inoculants for friendly systems on the fly.

Magnetic Shield
	[[SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO|SSC]]’s magnetic shield takes the same technology as their proprietary magnetic buckler and applies it to a massive field-projection system.
