The Monarch is [[SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO|SSC]]’s groundbreaking lesson in how to design a fast platform for the delivery of missiles and other self-propelled ordnance. Ready to mount ground-to-ground, ground-to-air, ground-to-orbit, and alltheater missiles and guidance systems, the Monarch can be customized for any payload and any target distance.

The Monarch’s large size often leads pilots to underestimate its agility. [[SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO|SSC]]'s rigorous design requirement of one designer per 10 Monarch printings is a mark of luxury in [[``Union|Union]]’s [[Galactic Core|Core]] world post-scarcity environment. This emphasis on purposeful scarcity is all that prevents the Monarch from achieving total battlefield dominance. The Monarch is commonly deployed in mixed line and fire-support roles, though field tests of a less resourcetaxing MicroMonarch mid- to close-range model is underway. The Monarch is part of [[SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO|SSC]]’s BELLA CIAO line of combat chassis.
