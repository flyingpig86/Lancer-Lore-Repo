The Monarch is [[SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO|SSC]]’s groundbreaking lesson in how to design a fast platform for the delivery of missiles and other self-propelled ordnance. Ready to mount ground-to-ground, ground-to-air, ground-to-orbit, and alltheater missiles and guidance systems, the Monarch can be customized for any payload and any target distance.

The Monarch’s large size often leads pilots to underestimate its agility. [[SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO|SSC]]'s rigorous design requirement of one designer per 10 Monarch printings is a mark of luxury in [[``Union|Union]]’s [[Galactic Core|Core]] world post-scarcity environment. This emphasis on purposeful scarcity is all that prevents the Monarch from achieving total battlefield dominance. The Monarch is commonly deployed in mixed line and fire-support roles, though field tests of a less resourcetaxing MicroMonarch mid- to close-range model is underway. The Monarch is part of [[SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO|SSC]]’s BELLA CIAO line of combat chassis.

SSC-30 HIGH-PENETRATION MISSILE SYSTEM
	*The SSC-30 High-Penetration Missile System (SSC-30 HPMS) is a mech-mounted micro-missile delivery system capable of tremendous combat output. Using the SSC-30 HPMS, the Monarch can carry – and deliver – its payload of 60 or more deadly, miniaturized Avenger warheads in a single volley.*

Javelin Rockets
	*“Pralaya was the name of your mother. She who would see the dawn-at-the-end. Her beauty was terrible, and her wrath, and I see it in all of you. My sons, when you hear the sound of thunder – that is your mother’s voice, and the rain of missiles her gift.”*

Sharanga Missiles
	*“It was a duel. This is why they were made: to duel, and in that combat, to shake the pillars of the universe.”*

Gandiva Missiles
	*Gandiva missiles are a reliable mainstay from Smith-Shimano’s BELLA CIAO line. Like the heavier Pinaka, the Gandiva is equipped with jet-assisted midflight repositioning systems, enhancing target navigation in rapidly changing battlefield environments. The Gandiva’s delivery platform is administered by a hivemind comp/con drone AI, giving it the capacity to learn from each right-of-launch experience.*

Stabilizer Mod
	*Stabilizer mods enhance physical mounts and targeting software, ensuring weapons remain level, steady, and at an appropriate angle regardless of terrain or pilot maneuvers.*

Pinaka Missiles
Pinaka missiles are massive, two-stage missiles typically mounted along a mech’s spine or carried, disassembled, to be launched from a brachial mount. The Pinaka was originally adapted from shipto- ship missiles; as such, their second stage uses jet-assist repositioning for midflight orientation.
