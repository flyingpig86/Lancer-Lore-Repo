The Zheng is a new frame in IPS-N’s line and is unusual in that its development can be attributed almost completely to a single mech pilot – Xiong Xiaoli, a Mirrorsmoke mercenary operating in the Long Rim, protecting heavy freight/low crew shipments to the early Dawnline Shore colonies. A relative unknown before the incident, MSMC documentation from the time indicates that her convoy was attacked by the White Tiger pirate conglomerate, and her entire company killed in action. Xiong’s personal logbook, recovered posthumously, expounds on MSMC’s report.
