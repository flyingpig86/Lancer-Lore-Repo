The Zheng is a new frame in [[ISP-NORTHSTAR|IPS-N]]’s line and is unusual in that its development can be attributed almost completely to a single mech pilot – Xiong Xiaoli, a Mirrorsmoke mercenary operating in the Long Rim, protecting heavy freight/low crew shipments to the early Dawnline Shore colonies. A relative unknown before the incident, [[MIRRORSMOKE MERCENARY COMPANY|MSMC]] documentation from the time indicates that her convoy was attacked by the White Tiger pirate conglomerate, and her entire company killed in action. Xiong’s personal logbook, recovered posthumously, expounds on [[MIRRORSMOKE MERCENARY COMPANY|MSMC]]’s report.

In her logbook, Xiong noted that her chassis, a factory-standard [[ISP-NORTHSTAR|IPS-N]] Raleigh, was almost totally ripped apart in the chaos of the White Tiger’s attack. Thrown free of her billeted freighter after it collided with a White Tiger crashboat, Xiong managed to survive the next 45 days by scavenging across the drifting, derelict wreck of the [[MIRRORSMOKE MERCENARY COMPANY|MSMC]]-S Say No More, the escort cruiser attached to the supply colony. Outnumbered and hunted by the White Tiger pirates prowling the ruined convoy, Xiong took dramatic steps to modify her Raleigh for close-quarters combat. In the dark, claustrophobic environments of the Say No More and ruined freighters leashed to it by the White Tigers, Xiong turned her chassis into a machine of tumbling death.

Xiong likely did not survive the long engagement. She is presumed to have perished mere days before an [[ISP-NORTHSTAR|IPS-N]] Trunk Security patrol arrived, responding to the convoy's initial distress signal. Trunk Security found that Xiong had eliminated every White Tiger pirate assigned to the convoy; her chassis, logbook, and trace elements of her body were discovered in the White Tiger’s cored-out gunboat and recovered by [[ISP-NORTHSTAR|IPS-N]]. Thanks to her efforts, Trunk Security and [[MIRRORSMOKE MERCENARY COMPANY|MSMC]] were able to hunt down the remaining White Tiger gang and eliminate them. [[ISP-NORTHSTAR|IPS-N]] and [[MIRRORSMOKE MERCENARY COMPANY|MSMC]] then engaged in a lengthy negotiation over the modified Raleigh’s plans, eventually settling on a mixed licensing fee that benefits both [[ISP-NORTHSTAR|IPS-N]] and [[MIRRORSMOKE MERCENARY COMPANY|MSMC]]. The resulting pattern, the Zheng, is now a popular choice among [[MIRRORSMOKE MERCENARY COMPANY|MSMC]] and Trunk Security pilots operating across the Rim.

Xiong Xiaoli is widely regarded as a bodhisattva across the Long Rim; [[MIRRORSMOKE MERCENARY COMPANY|MSMC]] mercenaries have created several drinking games named after her, and [[MIRRORSMOKE MERCENARY COMPANY|MSMC]] pilots on combat contracts often compete to hit the “Xiong Limit” of 45+ confirmed kills.

XIONG-TYPE CQB SUITE
	*Surviving mostly on colonial rations and an increasingly radioactive air supply, Xiaoli scavenged materials from a dying ship to create modifications that gave her mech unprecedented unarmed striking power.*

Tiger-Hunter Combat Sheathe
	*This enhancement encases a mech’s manipulators and brachial structures in a powerful reactive alloy weave, allowing it to use its fists as blunt weapons, even unarmed.*

Total Strength Suite I
	*This whole-system upgrade was the result of tweak Xiong Xiaoli made to her mech throughout a long career with the [[MIRRORSMOKE MERCENARY COMPANY|MSMC]], many of which have now been incorporated into standard [[ISP-NORTHSTAR|IPS-N]] frame construction protocol. The package comes in three stages, the first of which contains a set of spinal enhancements that allow a mech to rapidly lift and move large weights without systemic damage.*

Molten Wreathe
	*Needing a significant boost to her Raleigh’s melee capacity, Xiong decided upon a crude but effective solution: she would re-route her Raleigh’s coldcore dispersion systems into the chassis’ palms with a simple on/off switch, allowing it to superheat equipped weapons. The resultant ad hoc thermal weapon is so hot that it prompts an explosive vaporization of hard and soft surfaces on impact, creating a secondary backblast cloud that is a deadly weapon in its own right. The production version of this system simply adds a sturdier, dedicated routing system and better insulation.*

Total Strength Suite II
	*The second part of Xiong’s enhancement package: interlocking muscle-analog plates beneath armor, finely tuned to greatly multiply crushing force.*

D/D 288
	*The Zheng’s Devastator/Demolition Weapon 288 is legendary for its ability to breach armor and inflict total destruction on hardened targets. Originally rigged up as a last resort by Xiong Xiaoli, this fistmounted system repurposes a mech reactor’s primary heat vent into a directional, engagement-proximity weapon. The production line D/D 288 must be primed before firing, requiring a dangerous power draw from the mechs’ systems; Trunk Security’s reportage of the recovery mission assumes that using this weapons is what killed Xiong Xiaoli and cored the White Tiger’s gunboat. The D/D 288’s ability to cause enormous collateral damage and its spectacular discharge when fired have earned it the moniker ‘Shā mǎ zhǎng’ or Horse-Killing Palm among [[MIRRORSMOKE MERCENARY COMPANY|MSMC]] pilots.*

Total Strength Suite III
	*The last component of the Total Strength upgrade package gives a mech the ability to inject rapid bursts of intense power into its locomotive systems, resulting in short-lived but incredible strength. The underlying systems are carefully calibrated and misuse can rip apart a mech’s internal systems from within.*
