# Post-Scarcity
In practice, “post-scarcity” means that people on Core worlds will have access to most (unrestricted) consumer goods and not want for raw and necessary materials. Specialized items might require certain licenses that can be obtained through trade, clearance, or qualifications, but even these are readily available once approval has been granted or secured. Any unrestricted items so ordered can be reliably obtained at the time they are requisitioned, or within a day or two at most. 

On Diasporan worlds, the degree of scarcity depends on levels of development and access to resources, and can be subject to shortages, resource-hoarding, and so on. PCs can access necessary goods (unless there is a shortage, rationing, etc.) and raw materials are widely available. Specialized items might be difficult to obtain for any number of reasons: they’re limited in number, kept under lock and key by the colonial governor; they’re in the hold of a downed ship on the other side of the world; there are only so many remaining until the last supply ship arrives; and so on. The people of Diasporan worlds tend to expect some sort of currency in exchange for goods, services, and labor.
