*“And Throne Karrakis, from which all power flows.”
– Umara II, Record-Keeper of the House of Water.*

A federation of the largest and most powerful monarchies in known space, the Karrakin barons claim to represent the oldest unbroken civilization in human history. Seeded prior to the Fall and isolated after, the rulers of Karrakis were lost and forgotten to [[Cradle|Earth]] for thousands of years, free to expand and develop a spacefaring civilization even while the rest of humanity struggled to survive the Fall, the dark ages, and the Little Wars. By the time [[``Union|Union]] reached back out into space, the barons had spread to worlds throughout their system, designed a functioning – if cumbersome – system of interplanetary administration without the benefit of the [[omninet]] or the blink, and developed their own enormous network of machine minds to assist in the functioning of their dynastic monarchy.

Karrakis has the distinction of being one of the only pre-Fall colonies to survive the withering effects of the dark ages – any others, to the best of [[``Union|Union]]’s knowledge, were spawned from generation ships that were launched from a dying [[Cradle]] in the midst of the Fall. The Baronies, despite its status now as a member state of [[``Union|Union]], carries a fierce cultural independence that often causes friction between [[``Union|Union]] and Baronic state counterparts.

Now split into many houses by the effects of relativistic travel and multi-system distribution, the Baronies is comprised of a massive, byzantine system of titles, hereditary claims, and territories. There are thousands of minor houses, each swearing fealty to their world’s Major House, which in turn guarantees and is guaranteed by the monarchal power of the Prime Baron.

The Baronies controls some of the largest single-party mining, harvesting, and natural resource endeavors in the galaxy – operations that certainly enable the prosperity of the [[Galactic Core]]. The operations overseen by the Baronies are enormous in scale and ambition, eclipsed only by [[``Union|Union]] and rivaled only by the Aun. The major houses – the largest among them – have the capacity to undertake utterly massive mega-engineering projects, from tearing apart whole stars for their energy to cracking newly formed worlds for their minerals, transforming entire colonial ventures into planet-sized agrifactories, and sucking the atmospheres from gas giants.
