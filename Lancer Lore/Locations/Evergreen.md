# Sites

## Governor's Farm
The “Governor’s Farm” is the administrative heart of Evergreen. Built in the center of the city, the Governor’s Farm is a walled complex containing numerous important buildings.

## Council Hall
The meeting hall for Evergreen’s town council is a large, low, ferrocrete building, the Council Hall is populated at all times by a steady stream of people involved in the administration of the city.

## Print Shop
The colony’s largest printer, and its only scheduled one – the “Print Shop” – is in the Governor’s Farm, where it is kept publicly accessible during regular working hours. The printer is built inside a three-story, fully enclosed building protected by armed guards at all times. A command tower sits adjacent to the printer and catwalks ring the inside of the structure at intervals. The gasses and waste products from the printing process are vented high above the printer, where most are captured and recycled before they can pollute the atmosphere. Until the installation of an omninode, the printer only had access to its onboard library of industrial and civilian equipment. As an S2 printer, it can produce items, machinery, and vehicles up to Size 2, as long as the correct licensing requirements are met. There are a number of smaller print decks inside the shop that can be used simultaneously to produce mechs and other objects up to Size 3, although doing so requires some manual assembly.

## Residential Districts
The city’s residential districts are generally composed of mixed high-density apartments, transit corridors, and short, walkable blocks. The western quadrants are the most built up, and the least occupied – they were built for future generations to move in and occupy. The streets in those areas are largely vacant. The eastern side, meanwhile, is lower built and less dense – though not significantly so – and is home to the bulk of Evergreen’s population.

# Layout & Surroundings

Evergreen’s western edge is bordered by a wide, slow-moving river. Across the water is a broad expanse of semi-developed farmland that stretches for kilometers before petering out into thick, temperate rainforest.

The colony’s initial urban growth boundary was defined by Patience, the colony’s administrative NHP, and staked out by planners and construction workers. Tall, vacant apartment blocks stand close to the river – ten-plus stories of habitats built, sealed, and awaiting their tenants – and loom over the comparatively small, populated inland districts, which are composed of smaller apartment blocks, two to three stories tall.

This eastern side of Evergreen looks out towards the strait. A squat prefab wall rings the current boundaries of the city; beyond is a muddy clear-cut, expanding every day as massive drone cutters and their handlers chew into the old growth east of the city center. The colony’s landing bowl – where ships land and depart – rests a few kilometers southeast of the settlement as well. Until the summer, it is flooded, the pad at the bottom in need of repair.
