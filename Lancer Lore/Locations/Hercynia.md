in the fourth ring of [[``Union|Union]] space, the Atlas Line.

# Climate
Hercynia has a wet, temperate climate overall with breathable air that grows thin near its dry poles. The area around Evergreen is dominated by rainforests. Winters in this region are cold, dark, and wet, with snow at elevation and – in especially frigid winters – down near to sea level. The summers are long and humid with a protracted rainy season of around 40– 50 days in the pre-fall months, during which thunderstorms are common.

A fast-spinning world, Hercynia enjoys a 20-hour day and a 305-day year, with long daylight hours (16 –18) in the summer and shorter days in the winter.

The rain on Hercynia is slightly acidic due to leftover atmospheric refuse from the war. Because of this, gear left outside for long periods tends to degrade faster and coverings are recommended for both buildings and people during the wet season.
