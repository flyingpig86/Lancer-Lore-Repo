Cradle is Union’s homeworld, the planet we call Earth

>[!info]
>Union’s name for both Earth and the Sol system, used interchangeably.

Cradle and the system in which it can be found (Sol, or the Andes Core) are highly developed, densely populated, and dedicated to the daily maintenance, planning, and operations of Union. Humanity's ancestral homeworld is the beating heart of the galactic hegemon: part memorial, part privileged residence, part central hub.
