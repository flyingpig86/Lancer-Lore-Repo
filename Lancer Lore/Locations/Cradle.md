>[[``Union|Union]]’s name for both Earth and the Sol system, used interchangeably.

Cradle is [[``Union|Union]]’s homeworld, the planet we call Earth

Cradle is the administrative and cultural heart of [[``Union|Union]], humanity’s birthplace – once called “Earth” – and the capital of the populated galaxy. It has a permanent population of two billion, mostly made up of administrative and support staff for the Central Committee, numerous [[``Union|Union]] bureaus, many archives and research campuses, and Cradle’s indigenous populations. The people of Cradle refer to themselves primarily as humans, Terrans, or – less commonly – Solars or Gaians. When speaking of their home, they refer simply to Cradle, or to the planet, station, or moon they call home. The Sol system – often interchangeably called Cradle as well – is also home to a massive transient population of [[Cosmopolitans]] and [[Diasporans]] engaged in trade, diplomatic, scientific, and religious missions to and from the rest of the galaxy

Cradle and the system in which it can be found (Sol, or the Andes [[Galactic Core|Core]]) are highly developed, densely populated, and dedicated to the daily maintenance, planning, and operations of [[``Union|Union]]. Humanity's ancestral homeworld is the beating heart of the galactic hegemon: part memorial, part privileged residence, part central hub.

## Venus
#update
Venus is an archive world. Its surface is scattered with populated stations meant for rotational work and field research rather than long-term occupation. The planet hasn’t been terraformed and remains hostile to human life outside of its vast, subterranean archives. [[``Union|Union]]’s prime [[Non-Human Persons|NHPs]] are kept on Venus, entombed beneath the massive pressure of the world’s inhospitable atmosphere for study since the Deimos Event. Its population centers, Morningstar and Venera Final, are kept suspended in the world's upper atmosphere by a combination of downwell anchors, massive balloons, and orbital ballast.
