>[[``Union|Union]]’s name for both Earth and the Sol system, used interchangeably.

Cradle is [[``Union|Union]]’s homeworld, the planet we call Earth

Cradle is the administrative and cultural heart of [[``Union|Union]], humanity’s birthplace – once called “Earth” – and the capital of the populated galaxy. It has a permanent population of two billion, mostly made up of administrative and support staff for the Central Committee, numerous [[``Union|Union]] bureaus, many archives and research campuses, and Cradle’s indigenous populations. The people of Cradle refer to themselves primarily as humans, Terrans, or – less commonly – Solars or Gaians. When speaking of their home, they refer simply to Cradle, or to the planet, station, or moon they call home. The Sol system – often interchangeably called Cradle as well – is also home to a massive transient population of [[Cosmopolitans]] and [[Diasporans]] engaged in trade, diplomatic, scientific, and religious missions to and from the rest of the galaxy

Cradle and the system in which it can be found (Sol, or the Andes [[Galactic Core|Core]]) are highly developed, densely populated, and dedicated to the daily maintenance, planning, and operations of [[``Union|Union]]. Humanity's ancestral homeworld is the beating heart of the galactic hegemon: part memorial, part privileged residence, part central hub.

Cradle is a world healing from the cataclysms of the Anthropocene. Before the Fall, Old Humanity ravaged the world: even as those who came before cracked the wonders of the universe, they grew a cancer in the heart of the world that nearly scoured all life from its surface. Thousands of years later, in 5016u, Cradle still bears the markings of that epochal trauma, but the waters have lowered, the fires have quieted, and the seasons have calmed; in the wake of these shifts, humanity has slowly, carefully repopulated the world. These people have explored the ruins of their ancient cities, reopened old vaults of wonders, and built a new society – one that is strict in its stewardship, rejects the consumptive myth of permanent growth, and broadly eschews the excesses promised by capital.

To that end, Cradle is a calm world. Outside of population centers, it does not look like what one would imagine the galactic capital to look like. In contrast to the glittering metroswathes of Karrakis or built-up population bands of Ras Shamra, the vast bulk of Cradle’s landmass is given over to the natural world. The communities that exist in these spaces are connected by minimal-impact high-speed rail lines and ground-to-orbit flights restricted to polarity cities along the equator. Off the clock, life is generally slow and peaceful, marked by an aversion to the conspicuous consumption of the galaxy’s wonders. Great parks preserve the remains of the pre-Fall world – reminders to those who live now of the dangers of hubris, of consumption, of rapidity – and Cradle’s many museums display the recovered histories of Old Humanity. The world is either a sober memorial or a nostalgic trap, depending on who you ask.

There are still wonders tucked away in the lost corners of our ancient homeworld, and some terrors locked even deeper. Union may have seen turbulent times as regimes are dissolved and cobbled together, but its bureaucracy has a long memory. Nothing is more important to remember than which depths should be explored – and with the greatest care.
