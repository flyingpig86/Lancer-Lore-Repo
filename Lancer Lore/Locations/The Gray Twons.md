Some hundred kilometers to the east and south of [[Evergreen]] are dozens of the so-called “Gray Towns” – the “gray” in the name describing their legal relationship to [[Landmark Colonial|Landmark]]. [[The Châus|Liu Maize]] and [[Merricktown]] are the largest of these settlements. They serve as social hubs for the uncounted, noncitizen population that lives around [[Evergreen]].

The Gray Towns are primarily agricultural, with little heavy industry beyond logging and some light, surface-level mining. Few buildings stand above two stories and the tallest reach only four. Save for the crossroad clusters of buildings that form their civic centers, the Gray Towns are very lightly populated. Most people live in small clusters of two to four families working many hundreds of acres, or as hired hands on those large agricultural properties.
