# Clones under SeccComm

Under the [[Second Committee]], facsimile clones were a popular option for states, corporations, and other bodies in need of labor, constituents, or a ready supply of soldiers. The Anthrochauvinist government viewed clones not as individual persons, but as the legal property of their donors – a residual patriarchal construct that identified donors as the “progenitors” of their offspring, giving them full legal authority over beings that would not have existed without the donor’s intervention.

Essentially, facsimile clones – to say nothing of flash clones, explained in the following paragraphs – were second-class persons. Their individuality was recognized, but their legal rights were truncated on the basis that they were the results of “investments” made by their progenitors. Thus, they could be pressed into military, labor, or other dangerous services, with their owners only mandated to provide the bare minimum level of care – enough to ensure they didn’t die of hunger, thirst, or “reasonably preventable illness or exposure”.

Under SecComm, facsimile clones were widely used throughout the galaxy by state and private militaries, with specific martial traits emphasized by geneticists; at the same time, facsimiles conditioned in the company schools of corpro-states were used to staff many “soft” labor positions. In the [[New Karrakin Trade Baronies|Baronies]] particularly, facsimiles often occupied the highest echelons of society as ideal heirs, doubles, and tokens for the trade of pleasure or favors.
