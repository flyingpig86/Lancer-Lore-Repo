A pan-galactic mercenary organization known for its low rates, broad portfolio, and civic legitimization service, the Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company (MSMC) is formally incorporated as a “grayspace” private military company. No job is too big or too small, as long as a [[``Union|Union]] state in good standing will call it legal. Greyspace is an informal term, perfect for Mirrorsmoke’s preferences: the company’s legal corps, in contrast with the private military branch, is considered a prestigious, cutthroat interstellar firm, specializing in orbital, terrestrial, and criminal law.

MSMC carries a weighty reputation. Its private military branch is known throughout the galaxy as a stateless clearinghouse for all manner of recruits, from experienced veterans to raw cadets. The bar for enlistment is low: if you can sign your name or follow instructions to mark a contract – and agree to pay a personalized enlistment fee – you can get yourself a ticket to one of MSMC’s training facilities. The more experience or capability an applicant has (as determined by the MSMC evaluation exam, “The Milkrun”), the more incentives they are offered – from waived enlistment fees to fast-tracking in a training program of choice, and even offers of commission.

As a mercenary company, Mirrorsmoke competes against many thousands of firms — Goblin Throne Industrial, The Golden Hand, and others — for two types of contracts: perfectly legal high-volume, lowto- medium payout contracts, and low-volume, highpayout “grayspace” contracts. Although grayspace jobs are offered by states, corpro-states, and other legitimate organizations, the jobs themselves are less clearly above board. The targets of grayspace contracts often challenge them as piracy, looting, or illegitimate corporate takeovers – hence the need for a crack legal corps.

MSMC’s leadership is concerned with two things: keeping up recruitment, and clearing contracts. In order to provide as broad a selection of services as possible, the company positions itself as the lowest bidder on all kinds of work. MSMC has a proven track record of success in everything from putting down rebellions, to bug hunts, assassinations, private security, and protection rackets. Because of the questionable nature of much of the work they do, MSMC’s pilots and troopers bear the unfortunate nickname, “the garbage men of the galaxy”. The nicknames given to the company’s lawyers are much worse.

In spite of its greasy reputation, Mirrorsmoke provides valuable opportunities to its recruits. It is a licensed mercenary company and offers a host of services to employees looking to re-establish citizenship, clear penal records, wipe out debt, and earn basic certifications. The work might be messy, dangerous, and borderline criminal, but MSMC service qualifications are useful for people who have nothing else.

Career MSMC mercenaries are typically hardened, ambitious, or desperate people who pride themselves on their work. They take on problems that no one else is willing to fix, that polished toy soldiers turn their noses up at. It’s not uncommon to find MSMC mercs planetside and stationside, drinking and carousing in tight-knit groups, getting into scraps with other mercenaries and soldiers, or regaling audiences with stories from their latest missions.

The life of an MSMC mercenary is dangerous and difficult, but it does offer an escape from the normalcy of the civilian world. To some, MSMC represents a chance at becoming a mech pilot, or a chance to leave their backwater colony world and see the stars. For others, it’s a way out of an untenable living situation or crippling debt, or a way to leave their old life behind and become – legally – a whole different person. MSMC can be a lifeline, just as it can be a refuge for those looking to fight.

It’s easy to join Mirrorsmoke, and there’s always room for advancement: MSMC missions have high casualty rates, and survivors are quickly promoted as they display their competency. Following training, new recruits are assigned either to a local detachment or a unit matching their future specialization. These semiautonomous detachments are equivalent to battalions in traditional militaries. PCs with Mirrorsmoke backgrounds are (or were) likely part of one such unit. 

MSMC detachments are identified with numbered designations (between 001 and 999) and an unofficial nickname or two (e.g., the MSMC 501st Detachment, popularly known as the “One-Eyed Fox” or “the Here- For-Nows”). Each detachment is led by a board officer, who keeps at least one partner from Mirrorsmoke Legal on staff. They are empowered to seek out, negotiate, and execute contracts independently, but must report quarterly (in [[``Union|Union]] Realtime) to MSMC’s central omni address. 

Like its mercenary corps and detachments, MSMC’s legal teams take on intimidating names: Jackal and Hades, Esq., for example, is one of the more notorious firms. 

The current head of MSMC is Chief Executive Officer Centzon Alamdari.
