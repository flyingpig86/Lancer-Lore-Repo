A pan-galactic mercenary organization known for its low rates, broad portfolio, and civic legitimization service, the Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company (MSMC) is formally incorporated as a “grayspace” private military company. No job is too big or too small, as long as a Union state in good standing will call it legal. Greyspace is an informal term, perfect for Mirrorsmoke’s preferences: the company’s legal corps, in contrast with the private military branch, is considered a prestigious, cutthroat interstellar firm, specializing in orbital, terrestrial, and criminal law.

MSMC carries a weighty reputation. Its private military branch is known throughout the galaxy as a stateless clearinghouse for all manner of recruits, from experienced veterans to raw cadets. The bar for enlistment is low: if you can sign your name or follow instructions to mark a contract – and agree to pay a personalized enlistment fee – you can get yourself a ticket to one of MSMC’s training facilities. The more experience or capability an applicant has (as determined by the MSMC evaluation exam, “The Milkrun”), the more incentives they are offered – from waived enlistment fees to fast-tracking in a training program of choice, and even offers of commission.

As a mercenary company, Mirrorsmoke competes against many thousands of firms — Goblin Throne Industrial, The Golden Hand, and others — for two types of contracts: perfectly legal high-volume, lowto- medium payout contracts, and low-volume, highpayout “grayspace” contracts. Although grayspace jobs are offered by states, corpro-states, and other legitimate organizations, the jobs themselves are less clearly above board. The targets of grayspace contracts often challenge them as piracy, looting, or illegitimate corporate takeovers – hence the need for a crack legal corps.

MSMC’s leadership is concerned with two things: keeping up recruitment, and clearing contracts. In order to provide as broad a selection of services as possible, the company positions itself as the lowest bidder on all kinds of work. MSMC has a proven track record of success in everything from putting down rebellions, to bug hunts, assassinations, private security, and protection rackets. Because of the questionable nature of much of the work they do, MSMC’s pilots and troopers bear the unfortunate nickname, “the garbage men of the galaxy”. The nicknames given to the company’s lawyers are much worse.
