"Ungratefuls” is the name given to members of the widespread resistance movement within the [[Karrakin Trade Baronies|Baronies]]. The resistance started among indentured laborers in the mines of the now-defunct House Ludra, a minor house pledged to the House of Stone. Although it was initially a local opposition effort, a massacre of striking workers on one of the House of Stone’s tethered moons quickly caused it to blossom into an armed and organized rebellion. The Ungratefuls’ message of liberation is a popular one that has inspired many underground resistance movements across the galaxy.

The movement’s name – the Ungratefuls – was coopted from an early propaganda offensive against the strikers – one that cast them as ungrateful for the bounties the [[Karrakin Trade Baronies|Baronies]] had given them. The resistance came to be known as the Ungratefuls through a combination of popular usage and ideology. To be grateful for the [[Karrakin Trade Baronies|Baronies]]’ gifts would be to support the system that enables them – to tacitly approve of oppression, exploitation, and the other normal functions of monarchy. To be Ungrateful is to reject that system. The term has become a point of pride for partisans, agents, agitators, and organizers, although they do not use it to describe themselves. They are much more likely to use “comrades”, “siblings”, and other affectionate terms of address. More broadly, members of the resistance refer to themselves as Free Peoples.

Ungrateful cells are small, tight-knit, and reliant on mass movements to affect material change. Their tactics center on targeted harassment of political enemies and the organization and radicalization of laborers, particularly in the mines, factories, and fields of the [[Karrakin Trade Baronies|Baronies]].

Beyond this, Ungrateful activity ranges in scope from the local to the interstellar. Some cells focus on direct actions in their local mines, factories, farms, or worlds; others direct their actions at the [[Karrakin Trade Baronies|Baronies]] and beyond, including [[``Union|Union]] as the ultimate enabler of the systems that oppress them. Their methods are just as varied, encompassing everything from peaceful strikes and demonstrations to education programs in the mines, out-and-out attacks on Baronic assets and VIPs, and even strikes against [[``Union|Union]] targets.
