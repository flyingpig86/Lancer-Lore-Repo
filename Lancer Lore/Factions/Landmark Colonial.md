Landmark Colonial is an autonomous subsidiary of [[SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO|SSC]], and are represented by colors of blue & orange.
Although independent in its day-to-day operations, Landmark is subject to persistent (though distant) oversight by various SSC departments, branches, and special projects, including the Exotic Materials Group, Visual Development, certain working groups within the Constellar Congress, and even the Constellar Midnights.

# Landmark & Evergreen
Landmark Colonialâ€™s advance teams made landfall on Hercynia and established Evergreen in 4964u; since then, the colony has been successfully managed by its SIDEWALK-J2 administrative NHP, Patience. For 50 years, all seemed well. That changed following a series of attacks that took place from 5012 to 5013u, executed by unidentified but well-armed assailants. Patience, following standard crisis response protocols, issued a call for assistance.

Patience and the other administrative personnel of Evergreen are, technically, contractors for Landmark. Evergreen is considered its own autonomous partner of the colonization firm, and as such enjoys full rights and permissions to set its own policy just like any other municipality in a larger state would.
