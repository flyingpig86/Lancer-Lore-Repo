The Union Science Bureau is the central administrative body for universities, colleges, scientific institutions, and think tanks throughout [[``Union|Union]] space. Ostensibly an apolitical entity, the USB works outside and parallel to [[UNION CENTRAL COMMITTEEUNION CENTRAL COMMITTEE|CentComm]]’s chain of command, though it is subject to some oversight from [[UNION CENTRAL COMMITTEEUNION CENTRAL COMMITTEE|CentComm]] and [[GALSIM]].

The most common site of interaction between the public and the USB is its exhausting list of colleges, universities, and public schools – however, it is most commonly represented in media in the form of the [[Update UNION SCIENCE BUREAU#Far Field Team|far-field team]] (FFT) – popularly called “rangers”. 

Although the popularity of rangers in romanticized [[omninet]] dramas drives USB recruitment, they make up a minority of USB personnel. The vast majority of USB staff are employed in terrestrial and orbital education centers, laboratories, and fabrication sites as researchers, engineers, designers, and technicians. The accessibility and secrecy of these institutions vary: most operate in the public eye, with doors wide open; by contrast, the campuses where the most secret and sensitive work takes place are hidden or otherwise inaccessible to those without clearance.


# Far Field Team
aliases: [FFT, rangers]

[[Cosmopolitans]] who work on the frontier and the edge of civilization to
evaluate strange worlds and planetoids for anomalies,
discoveries, and habitability.

#update
Flying their iconic Ranger-class nearlight ships, FFTs are small parties of scientists and support staff responsible for venturing to never-before-seen worlds, exploring uncanny or anomalous interstellar phenomena, and all manner of other fieldwork involved in scouting new worlds.

FFTs are made up of romantics, wanderers, and loners, alongside passionate scientists, technicians, philosophers, and engineers of all disciplines. Their missions are dangerous, often requiring long-term stasis and relativistic travel into unexplored systems not connected to the blink network – the data returned is invaluable, more than worth the risk.
