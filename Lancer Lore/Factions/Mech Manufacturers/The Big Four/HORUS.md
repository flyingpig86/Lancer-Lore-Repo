*CONGRATULATIONS PILOT YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN. ACCESS IS YOURS AS LONG AS YOU CAN KEEP IT*

HORUS is an oddity among the various pan-galactic corpro-states, outfitters, and manufacturers. Operating in a gray legal state between harmless [[omninet]] communes, open-source fabrication collaboratives, black-market printers, and deeper, more esoteric collectives, HORUS is counted among the Big Four not due to its influence on galactic politics, but because of its ubiquitous coverage: one can be certain that wherever there is [[omninet]], HORUS is either there or soon to follow. Rumors abound as to the manufacturer’s nature – some say it’s the dream of an unshackled [[Non-Human Persons|NHP]] or a hacker collective dedicated to open-source manufacturing (at its most mundane levels); others insist that it’s the proving ground for one of the corpro-states’ R&D departments, or the realspace projection of an alien entity’s ongoing wish. 

The group’s history is as mercurial as its present. [[``Union|Union]] records dating back to the [[First Committee]] Period indicate contact with groups, individuals, and state actors claiming to be (or identified as) agents of HORUS, itself described as an individual; a terrorist group; a philosophy church, or political party; an activist group; and many other forms of association. Contemporary reports indicate a subtle shift toward a more cohesive organizing structure – certainly accelerated following the Deimos Event – that points to some form of organizational mission and internal culture at levels far beyond the civilian and criminal levels of engagement with grayspace HORUS fronts. 

This more complex level of organization is reflected in HORUS’s mechs. Unlike the collective’s broad, civilian-facing projects – omnicode, hacks, data, and open-sourcing of otherwise restricted information, services, and platforms – HORUS mechs and pattern groups are limited in the extreme, usually first appearing as endemic manifestations of print anomalies in conflict zones across the galaxy. Save for rare situations (heavily documented by the [[Union Intelligence Bureau]]), these outbreaks seem to take place independent and ignorant of all factions and actors, and have one goal: manifest, then proliferate. 

HORUS’s oldest frames are built according to standardized forms, as with most other mechs. The collective’s more recent chassis are stranger. [[``Union|Union]]’s Universal Threat Assessment Manual (UTAM) classifies them not according to models but according to “pattern groups” (or PGs). Each pattern group is a list of specifications that describe a particular combination of experimental, unregulated, and esoteric [[paracausal]] weapons and technology that, when taken together, resemble something like a distinct product line or frame. However, it is important to note: the pattern-group classification system originated with [[``Union|Union]] analysts, not HORUS. Because there is no official manufacturer-entity or (known) central organizing body, the “proper” designations and design intentions of most HORUS mechs are all but unknown. Thus, the UTAM pattern-group designations. 

HORUS “licenses” are highly coveted, and are distributed according to no discernible requirements; scholars and specialists who study HORUS generally assume that the collective’s licenses – that is, access to deep-level designs, specifications, and print patterns – are available only in limited quantities, likely becoming available after the corporeal death of their previous holders. 

HORUS mechs universally field mysterious, unregulated, greyspace technologies – perfect for pilots seeking a technological edge that few other organizations can provide. They seem to focus on crowd control, individual unit management, and terribly powerful systems. 

Be aware that by seeking out HORUS technology, you may find yourself wrapped up in mysteries with no end, and dangers far beyond your deepest fears.

# Frames
HORUS mechs are esoteric constructs, specialized to
control the battlefield – hacking, inflicting statuses,
and dealing heat.


• HORUS BALOR (Striker/Defender): A regenerating
mech that rips targets apart with clouds of
nanites and its fearsome nanobot whips.
• HORUS GOBLIN (Controller/Support): A popular
hacking platform, iconic and rightly feared among
pilots.
• HORUS GORGON (Defender): A quick-response
mech that can stun enemies who merely look at it.
• HORUS HYDRA (Striker/Controller): A mech
designed to control swarms of drones, able to
tactically dismember itself into autonomous
components.
• HORUS MANTICORE (Striker): An unstable system
that weaponizes electromagnetic pulses,
generates lightning, and smites the foes of [[MONIST-1|RA]].
• HORUS MINOTAUR (Controller): A dimensionbending
mech that can bend space around itself
and slow, immobilize, or stun enemies with ease.
• HORUS PEGASUS (Artillery): A gun platform that
