*From Cradle to the stars, GMS: assured quality, universal licensing, total coverage.*

General Massive Systems – GMS for short – is the galactic-standard supplier of just about everything. GMS developed the first mechs from up-armored hardsuits in 4500u, on Ras Shamra, the world that would become the capital of [[Harrison Armory]]; now, GMS’s flagship [[GMS Standard Pattern 1|Everest]] line of mechs sets the galactic standard. Reliable, sturdy, solidly built, and available in countless localized patterns, there are so many variants on the [[GMS Standard Pattern 1|Everest]] pattern that it has become totally ubiquitous and faded into the background. With universally compatible components, full radiation and environmental shielding, and tens of thousands of pre-loaded languages, a pilot in their [[GMS Standard Pattern 1|Everest]] has everything they need to get the job done. 

GMS is one of the oldest fabricators in the galaxy, first getting its start in the early days of the colonization rush. The manufacturer hails from [[Cradle]], the home of [[``Union|Union]] – and humanity – and thus its designs reflect the sensibilities of the first pioneers to seek the stars. Today, GMS products are available anywhere there is access to the [[omninet]]. These products, whether consumer, specialty, or military, are widely viewed as the galactic minimum of quality: not particularly luxurious, but unsurpassed in no-nonsense design, reliability, and ease of use. Where GMS is available, anything less is unacceptable. 

All GMS frames, gear, core bonuses, and licenses are available to all pilots, starting from license level 0. The default GMS mech is the Everest, a standardized allrounder FRAME.

# GMS MECH WEAPONS

Much like GMS mechs, GMS weapons are reliable galactic standards, made using interchangeable parts and built to withstand almost any conditions. There are three lines currently in production.

The **Type-I (T-1)** line is defined by powerful, reliable, and conventional-kinetic ranged and melee weapons, including the GMS assault rifle, heavy machine gun, shotgun, pistol, and various light and heavy blades. Reliable galactic standards, the GMS T-1 line is the most widely used mech-scale line of weaponry across the galaxy. Echoing the Everest’s design notes, T-1 weapons are simply designed, with few (if any) moving parts, intended to be used in or adaptable to any environment.

The **Type-II (T-2)** line displays GMS’s proprietary “charged” melee weapons and energy weapons. T-2 charged melee weapons are structurally similar to GMS’s T-1 melee weapons, though built with different materials to tolerate the intense heat generated by their projected plasma sheaths. These sheaths can be toggled on or off, depending on the needs of the pilot. GMS’s T-2 energy weapons, like their T-1 kinetics, are sturdy tools with predictable power scaling, minimal particle scattering, and consistent performance ranges. They feature universal ports allowing them to accept a variety of power sources, from hardline cabling through to “magazine” style power packs.

The **Type-III (T-3)** line is made up of heavy weapons, ordnance, and other exotic, specialized, or massive weapons. A broad classification, the T-3 range includes conventional-kinetic anti-materiel rifles, super-rapid cycling pulse rifles, missile racks, cannons, and drone nexuses – “hive”-style launchers that serve as miniature factory, hangar, and deployment systems for portable drones. The classification also includes the fearsome “segment knife”, a system that uses flash-printing to produce disposable edged weapons in a vicinity around the user.
