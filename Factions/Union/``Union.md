aliases: [Union, The Galactic Hegemony]

Created out of the hope to unit all of man-kind into a world without war, with the goal to insure the survival of humanity at all cost.

The vast mass of humanity is administered by a single sprawling government: <u><u>Union</u></u>, the galactic hegemony. [[Luna]] and [[Mars]], [[Mercury]] and [[Venus]]. [[Saturn]], [[Jupiter]], [[Neptune]], and [[Uranus]]. [[Phobos]] and [[Deimos. Io]], [[Europa]], [[Ganymede]], and [[Callisto]]. [[Titan]] and [[Enceladus]]. These worlds strung in their orbit around [[Cradle|Sol]] are the diadem atop which [[Cradle]] rests, the seat of <u>Union</u>’s power and humanity’s ancient heart. From [[Cradle]],<u>Union</u> controls the three levers of the galaxy: the [[blink gates]], the [[omninet]], and [[manna]]. Without these levers, and without <u>Union</u>, the galaxy would fall into chaos.

<u><u>Union</u></u> is a new kind of utopia. A new state – communal and post-capital – for a [[New Humanity]]. <u>Union</u> was born from the ashes and ice of the Fall: the collapse that felled [[Old Humanity]], boiling [[Cradle]] and withering her colonies entirely. Though it has been thousands of years since <u>Union</u> was founded – and thousands more since [[the Fall]] – [[New Humanity]] knows only one truth among ten thousand unknowns: if we are to survive, then we must come together in solidarity and mutual aid.

Despite <u>Union</u>’s conviction – and despite its successes so far – the sheer size of this collective project is daunting. <u>Union</u> is distant to most people: fictionalized in [[omninet]] dramas and novels; dreamed about by children and wanderers; hailed as the promised kingdom or damned as the pit by religions across the galaxy. For all its authority, <u>Union</u> prefers to rule from a distance. Few have ever seen one of [[Union’s administrators]], let alone suffered one of its naval campaigns. For those who have never seen its flag, <u>Union</u> is all but a myth; for those whose skies have been darkened by <u>Union</u>’s ships, the hegemony may have brought liberty – but it brought death first.

# Committees
It's History is currently broken into 3 commenties:
[[First Committee]] (0U-2880U)
[[Second Committee]] (2880U-4591U)
[[Third Committee]] (4591U-Present)

# The Galaxy outside the Core
The galaxy remains a dangerous place outside the [[Galactic Core|Core]]. Rebellions, insurrections, piracy, wars – civil and interplanetary – continue to flare and burn their way through space, though only the most desperate conflicts require <u>Union</u>’s intervention. Disputes between <u>Union</u>’s subject states are common enough that there is still a need for militaries, militias, and mercenaries. Five major suppliers offer arms and armor to states and entities outside the [[Galactic Core|Core]] that desire them. These manufacturers exist in delicate balance with <u>Union</u>: though the administrators regulate and the suppliers comply, these two philosophies – one of post-capital utopia and the other of permanent and wild growth – rush toward an irreconcilable end.

# Terminology
Years are meassured by the creation of the First Committee:
BU = "Before <u>Union</u>"
U = "<u>Union</u> Era"
