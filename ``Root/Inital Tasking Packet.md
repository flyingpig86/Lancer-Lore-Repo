*Union has made the following information and rules of engagement available via their initial tasking packet:*

Current Year: 5016U

1. [[``Union|Union]]’s imperative dictates that the PCs treat the situation with utmost care. [[Hercynia]] is potentially populated by some sort of indigenous human culture, but the evidence is unclear.
2. The current holder of [[Hercynia]]’s charter is [[Landmark Colonial]], a subsidiary of [[Smith-Shimano Corpro]]. The PCs are to make contact with [[Landmark Colonial| Landmark]]’s representative on the ground first in order to present their credentials and integrate into the local hierarchy.

>3. [[Hercynia]] was once subject to a widespread and catastrophic [[Second Committee|SecComm]] expeditionary campaign. The records lack detail, but building from what has been recovered from the old [[Union Colonial Mission]] indicates that the [[Second Committee]] mounted a handful of similar campaigns against resistant populations. This likely accounts for the massive amount of radiation, distress signals, encrypted comms, and general “noise” coming off the world. The PCs should expect to encounter old [[``Union|Union]] military infrastructure in the form of unexploded ordinance, waste radiation, and possibly even abandoned ground-based installations.
